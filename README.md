The most recent version of this Agreement will be posted on the service under Settings. The most recent version is the version that applies. If the changes include material changes that affect your rights or obligations, we will notify you in advance of the changes by reasonable means, which could include notification/message through the Service or via email. If you continue to use the Service after the changes become effective, then you agree to the revised Agreement.

3. Rights we grant you

We grant you a personal, worldwide, royalty-free, non-assignable, non-exclusive, revocable and non-sublicensable licence to access and use the Services. This licence is for the sole purpose of letting you use and enjoy the Services’ benefits in a way that these Terms and our use policies such as <link>Safety Tips</link> and <link>Community Guideline</link> allow.

Any software that we provide you may automatically download and install upgrades, updates or other new features. You may be able to adjust these automatic downloads through your device’s settings.

You may not copy, modify, distribute, sell or lease any part of our Services, nor may you reverse engineer or attempt to extract the source code of that source code of that software, unless laws prohibit these restrictions or you have our written permission to do so.


4. Rights you grant us

Many of our services let you create, upload, post, send, receive and store content. When you do that, you retain whatever ownership rights in that content you had to begin with. But you grant us a license to use that content. How broad that license is deepens on which Services you use and the settings you have selected. 

For all public content you submit to the service, including posts or moments. For all content you submit to the Services other than Public Content, you grant PREE and our affiliates a worldwide, royalty-free, sub licensable and transferable license to host, store, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish and distribute that content. This license is for the limited purpose of operating, developing, providing, promoting and improving the Services and researching and developing new ones.

Because Public Content is inherently public and chronicle matters of public interest, the licence you grant us for this content is broader. For Public Content, you grant PREE, our affiliates and our business partners all of the same rights you grant for non-Public Content in the previous paragraph, as well as a perpetual licence to create derivative works from, promote, exhibit, broadcast, syndicate, publicly, perform and publicly display Public Content in any form and in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed). To the extent it’s necessary, when you appear in, create, upload, post or send Public Content, you also grant PREE, our affiliates and our business partners the unrestricted, worldwide, perpetual right and licence to use your name, likeness and voice, including in connection with commercial and or sponsored content. This means, among other things, that you will not be entitled to any compensation from PREE, our affiliates or our business partners if your name, likeness or voice is conveyed through the PREE application.

For information about how to tailor who can watch your content, please take a look at our <link>Privacy Policy≤/link>.

While we’re not required to do so, we may access, Reeves, screen, and delete your content at any time and for any reason, including to provide and develop the Services or if we think your content violates these Terms. However, you alone remain responsible for the content you create, upload, post, send or store through the Service.

The services may contain advertisements. In consideration for PREE. Letting you access and use the Services, you agree that we may place advertising on the Services. Because the Services contain content that you and other users provide us, advertising may sometimes appear near your content.

We always love to hear from our users. But if you provide feedback or suggestions, just know that we can use them without compensating you, and without any restriction or obligation to you, unfortunately.


5. Modifying the Service and termination 

PREE is always striving to improve the Service and bring you additional functionality that you will find engaging and useful. This means we may odd new product features or enhancements from time to time as well as remove some features, and if these actions do not materially affect your rights or obligations, we may not provide you with notice before taking them. We may even suspend the Service entirely, in which event we will notify you in advance unless extenuating circumstances, such as safety or security concerns, prevent us from so.

6. Safety; Your Interactions with Other Users

Though PREE strives to encourage a respectful member experience through features like the double opt-in that allows members to communicate only after they have both indicated interest in one another, it is not responsible for the conduct of any member on or off the Service. You agree to use caution in all interactions with other members, particularly if you decide to communicate off the Service or meet in person. In addition, you agree to review and follow PREE’s <link>Safety Tips</link> prior to using the Service. You agree that you will not provide your financial information (for example, your credit card or bank account information), or wire or otherwise send money, to other members.

7. Other User’s Content 

Although PREE reserves the right to review and remove Content that violates this Agreement, such Content is the sole responsibility of the user who posts it, and PREE cannot guarantee that all Content will comply with this Agreement. If you see Content on the Service that violates this Agreement, please report it within the Service.
